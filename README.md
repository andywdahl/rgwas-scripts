# rgwas-scripts

Code to reproduce the analyses in ``Reverse GWAS: Using Genetics to Identify and Model Phenotypic Subtypes''.

See my the ``rgwas'' github page the R package and a vignette. This github page, ``rgwas-scripts'', is not expected to be particularly useful.

No individual level data is included, so full reproduction of results from raw data is impossible. However, many intermediate .Rdata files have been included, which allow reproduction of the figures and tables.
