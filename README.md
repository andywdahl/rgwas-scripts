Code to reproduce the analyses in Dahl et al 2019 Plos Genetics:

Andy Dahl, Na Cai, Arthur Ko, Markku Laakso, PÃ¤ivi Pajukanta, Jonathan Flint, Noah Zaitlen. 2019. PLoS Genetics. Reverse GWAS: Using genetics to identify and model phenotypic subtypes. https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008009

See the "rgwas" repository for the R package and vignette: https://github.com/andywdahl/rgwas.

This repository is not expected to be particularly useful--no individual level data is included, so full reproduction of results from raw data is impossible. Nonetheless, many intermediate .Rdata files are included, to increase transparency and enable reproduction of the figures and tables.
